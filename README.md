# @juicerq/juibs

A typed job library over BullMQ. BullMQ is a good queue and a poor contract: a job is a string name plus untyped `data`, so every team rebuilds payload validation, a name-to-handler lookup, and a delivery policy that lives at the call site instead of with the job. juibs gives a job a name, a payload schema, a delivery policy and a place to run, so producers and consumers never share code. You declare a definition once and get a typed enqueue, a typed handler, validation on both sides, and correct behaviour for the expensive failure modes — an enqueue inside a database transaction that rolls back, a schedule deleted from the code but still firing in Redis, a job that runs twice after a pod restart, an envelope a rolling deploy cannot parse.

## Install
